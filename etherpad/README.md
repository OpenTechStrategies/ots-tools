This directory saves some research we've been doing into integrating
Etherpad with other programs (e.g., text editors).

The file
[test-etherpad-format.etherpad](test-etherpad-format.etherpad) is a
Etherpad-format export of [this test
pad](https://pad.opentechstrategies.com/p/test-etherpad-format).  Even
before we have true collaborative editing, it would be nice to at
least be able to upload text and have it be properly formatted in
Etherpad (e.g., with real nested lists, italics, bold, etc).  This
file might be useful sample data in learning how to do that.  After
all, *it* can be uploaded to produce a properly formatted pad, so if
we can just generate a file in this format, then we have at least
accomplished that goal.

See [this
discussion](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/discussions/5148)
about Etherpad Lite format.

Also, something like [ethermacs](https://github.com/zzkt/ethermacs)
might help.
