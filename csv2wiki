    out.write("""Convert each entry (row) in a CSV file to a MediaWiki page.

Basic usage:

  $ csv2wiki -c CONFIG_FILE [ --delete-matching=PATTERN ] CSV_FILE

The CONFIG_FILE contains the wiki URL, login information, and various
other run-time parameters.  It is in standard .ini file format, with
the following elements:

  wiki_url:      The url of the wiki, e.g. "http://localhost/mediawiki",
                 "https://www.example.com/mwiki", etc.

  username:      User account that has write/create permission in the wiki.
                 (With --delete option, user needs page-delete permission.)

  password:      The wiki password corresponding to the username.

  toc_name:      Title for the generated Table of Contents page.

  title_tmpl:    A string into which the row number is substituted to
                 create the title of each row's page.  Substitution is
                 done at the first "{}" in the string.  For example, if
                 title_tmpl "Entry_{}", then each page will be named
                 "Entry_001", "Entry_002", etc.  The amount of left-side
                 0-padding will be determined automatically by the
                 number of rows in the CSV input.

  cat_col:       The number of the column (if any) in the CSV file that
                 should be used to create a category for that row;
                 column numbering begins at 1, not 0.  Omit this, or
                 leave the value blank, to not use categories at all.

  delimiter:     A single-char delimiter used to separate columns in
                 a CSV row.  If omitted, defaults to ','.

  quotechar:     A single-char quotechar used to wrap contents of a
                 single cell in the CSV file.  If omitted, defaults
                 to '"'.

  path_to_api:   The API path under the URL; defaults to "/".  See also
                 http://mwclient.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/connecting.html.
                 Note that on Wikipedia.org, this would be "/w/", but in
                 most non-Wikipedia instances of MediaWiki, the default
                 "/" is more likely.  So if you're using that default, 
                 you don't have to specify this at all.

Example config file
-------------------

In this example config file, the "[csv2wiki]" section name at the top
is ignored -- it could be any value; the .ini format insists on
it, but this script doesn't (currently) use it.

  [csv2wiki]
  wiki_url: http://localhost/mediawiki
  username: wikibot
  password: wikibot1
  title_tmpl: Entry_{}
  toc_name: List_of_Entries
  cat_col: 5

Page deletion support
---------------------

This script also supports batch deletion of pages, since a possible
outcome of initial runs is that you have a bunch of pages in your wiki
that turn out to be not ready.  Use the "--delete-matching PATTERN"
option to remove them.  All pages whose names match PATTERN will be 
deleted (and no pages will be created).

Typically, PATTERN will be similar to the page_title config element,
since --delete-matching is most often used to delete pages originally
created with this script.

NOTE: We will probably change --delete to just re-calculate page
      titles based on the CSV input, instead of taking a PATTERN
      argument and then querying the MediaWiki API for a list of pages
      whose names match that PATTERN.  If we make this change, then
      the --delete-matching=PATTERN option will become just --delete
      with no argument.

Dependencies and Troubleshooting
--------------------------------

* You will need to install the 'mwclient' Python library.

  If you get an error that looks something like this:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "./csv2wiki", line 27, in <module>
        from xmwclient import Site
    ImportError: No module named xmwclient

  then do 'pip install mwclient' and try again.

* If you run create/delete multiple times, you may need to run
  
    $ php maintenance/rebuildall.php
  
  in your MediaWiki instance to link pages to their categories properly.
  That script takes about 10 minutes to run for a wiki with <300 pages.
  
* If you get errors saving some pages, it may be an anti-spam plugin.
  
  If your MediaWiki instance has Extension:SpamBlacklist enabled,
  then you may get errors when trying to create pages that contain
  certain kinds of URLs or email addresses (namely, URLs or email
  addresses that SpamBlacklist thinks look spammy). 
  
  One solution is to just turn off Extension:SpamBlacklist entirely.
  But even if you don't have that kind of administrative access,
  you might still have enough access to *configure* the extension, 
  in which case you can whitelist everything via a catchall regexp.
  Visit one or of of these pages:
  
    https://mywiki.example.com/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Spam-whitelist
    https://mywiki.example.com/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Email-whitelist
  
  You'll see a commented-out explanation of how the whitelist works.
  Just add a line with the regular expression ".*", as in this example:
  
    # External URLs matching this list will *not* be blocked even if they would
    # have been blocked by blacklist entries.
    #
    # Syntax is as follows:
    #   * Everything from a "#" character to the end of the line is a comment
    #   * Every non-blank line is a regex fragment which will only match hosts inside URLs
    .*
  
  That will let you save a page containing any URL.  (Things work
  similarly on the Email-whitelist page).

* Run time may be slower than you expect.

  Creating 250 wiki pages takes about 5 minutes on localhost.  
  Part of the reason for this is that the script does a page save
  for every section within a page; see the TODO comment near the 
  page.save() calls in the loop over cells for more.  We may look
  into whether the 'mwclient' library offers a caching option, or
  maybe we'll create the whole page and save it once at the end.
