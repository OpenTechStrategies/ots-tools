;;;; Overview
;;;; ========
;;;;
;;;; Most of this stuff is highly OTS-specific and probably not of
;;;; interest outside the company.  However, we publish it as free
;;;; software partly because that's our policy and partly because we
;;;; want to be able to conveniently refer others to this code --
;;;; either to ask them for suggestions on how to do something better
;;;; or to show an example to someone who wants one.  In particular,
;;;; some of the customizations we've made to Org Mode functionality
;;;; might be useful outside OTS.
;;;;
;;;; To use these functions, put something like this in your .emacs,
;;;; or your ~/.emacs.d/init.el, or whatever your Emacs init file is:
;;;;
;;;;   ;; Do 'git clone git@github.com:OpenTechStrategies/ots-tools.git'
;;;;   ;; to get the 'ots-tools' repository.
;;;;   (setq ots-dir (file-name-as-directory
;;;;                   (expand-file-name "~/path/to/ots-tools-dir")))
;;;;
;;;;   (let ((ots-elisp-root (concat ots-dir "emacs-tools")))
;;;;     (when (file-exists-p ots-elisp-root)
;;;;       (add-to-list 'load-path ots-elisp-root)
;;;;       (load "ots")))
;;;;
;;;; We try to stay compatible with the most recent official releases
;;;; of Org Mode, but... we don't try too hard.  If something related
;;;; to Org Mode seems not to be working, try running the development
;;;; version of Org Mode from git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git.
;;;;
;;;; To find the interactive entry points below, look for functions
;;;; that have an "(interactive ...)" form near the beginning.

defining \"OTS_DIR\" in the environment Emacs runs in, or by

  ;;      what the second line says to be true (because
  ;;      `g' is the traditional key for reloading, and
  ;;      it does `org-agenda-redo-all').
  ;;
  ;;   2) When the buffer is regenerated via `g' or `r'
  ;;      or `C-u r', our custom let-bound settings for
  ;;      `org-agenda-hide-tags-regexp' and
  ;;      `org-use-tag-inheritance' are no longer in
  ;;      effect, so the buffer is regenerated with
  ;;      newly-visible inherited lines and "DUE" tags.
  ;;      (Using `make-local-variable' for them doesn't
  ;;      work either, by the way.)
  ;;
